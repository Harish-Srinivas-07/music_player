# 🎶 Simple HTML Audio Player

A nostalgic first HTML project—a basic web audio player with a handful of Tamil songs. My first HTML project, updated now for lovely memory! 😄

> 🎓 Final project from a 6‑day HTML course: embeds audio URLs directly, clean layout, functional playback controls.


## 🔹 Features

- 🎵 Plays 5+ embedded Tamil songs  
- ▶️ Basic controls: Play, Pause, Next, Previous  
- 📜 Styled playlist using CSS  
- 💻 All client-side—no server setup required  
- 🧠 Great hands-on demo for learning HTML5 `<audio>` and JS playlist control



## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5 `<audio>`** — For embedded playback  
- **CSS3** — For styling and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript** — For managing playlist and playback logic


## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the player locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harish-Srinivas-07/music_player.git
cd music_player
open index.html
````

No need to download `.mp3` files—audio is streamed via embedded URLs in `script.js`.



## 🧭 Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click a track from the playlist.
3. Use the controls (Play/Pause, Next, Previous).
4. Enjoy your music—shout out if you'd like features added! 😄
